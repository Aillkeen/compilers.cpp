C++ Compiler Project
====================

This is just a project to exercise the concepts and theory of compilers. As you might guess, this is a C++ compiler and it will be built using JFlex and Cup.

### JFlex 1.5###

JFlex is a scanner generator. JFlex reads a lexical specification and outputs java sources for the generated parser. If you don't have experience with JFlex, access the [official website](http://jflex.de/) and try it! See the ```README``` file for more information and examples.
